Pattern Type: Behavioral

Purpose: The Template Pattern encapsulates a general 
algorithm in one place and lets subclasses redefine 
certain steps without changing the algorithm's structure.

Hooks: 
- A hook is a method defined in the abstract class
but is given a empty or default implementation.
This gives subclasses the ability to “hook into” 
the algorithm at various points, but can be ignored
if one chooses to do so.
